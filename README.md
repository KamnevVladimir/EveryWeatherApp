### Hello!
 
I created an application that will go to the site Openweather instead of you and receive information about the temperature and state of the sky outside.

To please your eye, there are two themes.

*If you want to try them out, then just change the design to dark in the iPhone settings*

When you start the phone, the temperature is immediately determined by your location. Don't forget to grant permission to track location on first launch.

#### Thus, the weather information can be obtained in three ways:

1) Just run the application
2) Enter the name of the city into the textfolder
3) Tap on the geolocation sign

*Used:*

- Core Location
- API Openweather
- URLSession for Networking
- MVC
- The Delegate Design Pattern
